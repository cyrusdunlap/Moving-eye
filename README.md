# Moving Eyes

## Description
As you move your mouse cursor around the screen the eyes will follow its movement. I used my own personal styling to create an emoji like charactor.

## How to run
1. Download the files to your computer.
2. Drag the index.html file into a blank browser.
3. Then move your cursor around the screen and have fun.

## Future Improvements
When I become more skilled I would like to add some custom animations to the screen to make the character more fun.
